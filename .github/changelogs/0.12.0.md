Refactoring incl. some bigger changes and updating to latest version of the game.

### Added
* Extension to get actual expedition number from `SeasonEnum` (e.g. Cartographers is always 3rd, Liquidators 14th)
* Another callback `IContainer.JsonChangedCallback` that gets invoked whenever the JSON inside changed (via the available API)
* New overload for `IPlatform.RestoreBackup` to enable writing directly to disk
* Support for game version **Aquarius 5.10**
* Aquarius Expedition

### Changed
* Renamed `IContainer.WriteCallback` to `PropertiesChangedCallback` to be more precise when it gets invoked
* Renamed `IPlatform.Backup` to `CreateBackup` and `IPlatform.Restore` to `RestoreBackup`
* Bump *CommunityToolkit* from 8.2.2 to 8.3.0
* Bump *libNOM.map* from 0.13.0 to 0.13.1

### Removed
* Removed `IContainer.SetJsonObject` from the public API, use `IPlatform.Rebuild` instead which will update and invoke everything properly
* Removed `IContainer.BackupRestoredCallback` in favor of new callback combination

### Fixed
* Always invoked `IContainer.WriteCallback` even if `OnWatcherDecision` was not executed
* Importing plaintext JSON files
