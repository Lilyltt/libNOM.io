Updated target frameworks according to the .NET release lifecycle, a critical fix for technology packages, and some other changes here and there.

### Added
* Beachhead Expedition Redux (2024)
* Holiday 2024 Expeditions

### Changed
* Now also targeting .NET 9 according to supported versions in the [.NET release lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)
* No longer targeting .NET 6 and .NET 7 (can be still used thanks to .NET Standard)
* `PlatformCollection.AnalyzePath` now also checks direct subfolders if path itself has no valid platform data
  * Similar to how default locations for PC platforms are added
  * Now returns `IEnumerable<IPlatform>` instead of `IPlatform?`
* `PATH` of PC platforms is not publicly accessible
* Bump *libNOM.map* from 0.13.3 to 0.13.4

### Fixed
* Technology packages gone after saving due to the hashes no being UTF-8 conform ([#210 in the NomNom repository](https://github.com/zencq/NomNom/issues/210))
