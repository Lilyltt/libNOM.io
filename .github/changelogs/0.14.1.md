Some remaining changes for Worlds Part II and support for Relics as well as some improvements for the CLI.

### Added
* Proper support for Worlds Part II patch 5.53 with new meta size
* Tests for Worlds Part I and II on all platforms
* Support for game version **Relics 5.60**
    * Detection for new packaged technology
* Relics Expedition

### Changed
* CLI
    * Renaming `Json*` arguments to make their purpose easier understandable
* Bump *libNOM.map* from 0.13.5 to 0.13.6

### Fixed
* CLI
    * Force stdout encoding for the read action to be UTF-8 as the default one may not support all characters and can break the resulting JSON
* Exception when having a really high play time (`IContainer.TotalPlayTime` is now `ulong`)
