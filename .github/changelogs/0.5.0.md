Some fixes mainly concerning the PlayStation platform.

### Changed
* PlatformCollection itself is now iterable and therefore `Get()` was removed

### Fixed
* Explicitly do not use compression for account data
* SaveWizard usage detection if savedata00.hg file (account data) is present
* Handling for compression when PlayStation platform is used
* Save Transfer for old saves
* Getter for deobfuscated JSON string (mostly old SaveWizard memory.dat)
* Unable to copy/transfer a save to an empty slot
