Update for Adrift, also including some other tweaks.

### Added
* `PlatformCollection.Contains(string path)` overload
* Support for game version **Adrift 4.70**
* Adrift Expedition

### Changed
* `PlatformSettings.MaxBackupCount <= 0` is disabling the backup feature again
  * Existing backups will be deleted the next time one would be created otherwise
  * To make it unlimited-like set it to `int.MaxValue`
* `Constants.LOWEST_SUPPORTED_VERSION` is publicly accessible
* Using the `IContainer` interface instead of `Container` directly, in interfaces and other public methods
* `Platform.RestartToApply` is now an enum for more precision on when a game restart is required

### Fixed
* The values for the properties `Container.ActiveContext` and `Container.CanSwitchContext` are now properly set even if the `Container` is not fully loaded
